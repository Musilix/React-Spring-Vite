  <blockquote>
  Task tracker is a basic application I made to keep track how many jobs I was applying to per day as well as keep a daily goal. It abstracts out a persons daily goals into simple tasks.
  <br/><br/>
  They're strict to a single context, so there's no description or title for the tasks. Nor do the tasks have to be specific to my use case of keeping track of jobs applied to. Instead, it's just personally understood what the daily task goal represents.
  <br/><br/>
  Tasks completed + daily tasks left are persisted through a SupaBase Postgres DB, and User auth is completed with Github/Google Passport strategies (almost).</blockquote>
